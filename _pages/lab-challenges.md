## 🎯 Challenge 1: Web Scraping & Data Collection

### Problem Statement
Extract structured hockey team statistics from a live website and transform the data into an analysis-ready format for further processing and visualization.

### Approach
1. **HTTP Request Handling**: Used Python's requests library to retrieve webpage content
2. **HTML Parsing**: Implemented BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract data from HTML tables
3. **Data Structuring**: Organized extracted data into Pandas DataFrame
4. **Data Export**: Saved structured data to CSV format for future analysis

### Tools Used
- **Python** with Requests library
- **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Google Colab** for development environment

### Key Lessons Learned
- Web scraping requires careful handling of website structure changes
- Data extraction from HTML tables can be automated for reproducible results
- Proper error handling is essential for robust web scraping scripts
- Structured data export enables seamless integration with analysis workflows
